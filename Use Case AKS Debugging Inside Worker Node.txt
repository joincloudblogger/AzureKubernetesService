Use Case: Access the internal system of an AKS worker node for debugging (like checking logs, files, processes).


We want to access inside an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) worker node to do some debugging.

In AKS, you can’t SSH directly into a node (like you do in a VM), so we use a special trick — we send a debug container** that opens a small window into the node, so we can go inside.


Step 1: Get the name of the node

kubectl get nodes



Step 2: Send a debug shell to that node

kubectl debug node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/busybox:2.0 --privileged
```

What this command does:

kubectl debug`: Sends a temporary debug container to the node.
--image`: Uses a lightweight Linux image (`busybox`) to run the shell.
--privileged`: Gives full access to the node’s system so we can explore everything.

Step 3: You’re now inside the node!

You’ll see a shell prompt like this:

/ #


This means you’re inside the debug container, which is running on the AKS workernode.

Step 4: Go inside the real node OS

```bash
chroot /host
```

Now you are inside the actual operating system of the node — just like an SSH session.

Step 5: Do your troubleshooting

Some useful commands:

```bash
ls /etc             # See configuration files  
cat /var/log/...    # Read system logs  
df -h               # Check disk space  
ps aux              # See running processes  
```



Step 6: Exit safely

```bash
exit
exit
```

First `exit`: gets you out of the chroot (real node system)
Second `exit`: gets you out of the debug container

---

Important Note:
The debug container is temporary — once you exit, it automatically stops and deletes itself. Nothing is left behind.

Full Example for Students:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl debug node/aks-nodepool1-12345678-vmss000000 -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/cbl-mariner/busybox:2.0 --privileged
chroot /host
ls /etc
exit
exit
```

If you want, I can also create:

* A **YouTube Shorts-style script**
* Or a **diagram/image** to explain this visually

Let me know which one you'd like!
